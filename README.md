Project Details
What We Need
Ongoing web development support for 10-15 hours over the course of 4 weeks
Support may include: website maintenance, updates or improvements
Note: We devised this project to connect nonprofits and volunteers for more flexible, more immediate impact. We strongly suggest you start with 4 weeks and decide from there if you'd like to continue working.
Additional Details
We need a page created to our existing website for a virtual event:
https://www.smilesforveterans.dental/

The event page should look similar to this:
https://thesmartride.org/

We would provide copy, photos, graphics, etc. We would like to launch the event in November sometime to run for 2 weeks.

What We Have In Place
We currently have a website, which should make it easy for you to get started. We also have videos, photos, graphics, and the ability to provide any other information you need.
How This Will Help
This project will save us $3,757  , allowing us to clear our waiting list of clients in Arizona and position the organization to go nationwide in 2021.
We had 5 cancelled fundraisers due to Covid-19. This virtual event will help us financially. Our waiting list of Veterans in need of critical dental care is close to 150.
